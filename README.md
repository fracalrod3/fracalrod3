- 👋 Hi, I’m @fracalrod3
- 👀 I’m interested in: Python, JavaScript, HTML, Django, BeautifulSoup and many more! But also games, design and I have many ideas but currently WIP
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: rly nothin' even though college's supposed to teach u a lot, i mean i'm learning it's just that i have to do it all by myself
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: idk i'm up for whatever
- 📫 How to reach me: yea u wish i'd tell u huh
- 😄 Pronouns: Giorno/Giovanna
- ⚡ Fun fact: As i said b4, got great ideas on hold until I got a more stable schedule (rn college's got my time all messed up). Hopefully it'll get better on that front when I finish and find an internship or a job
