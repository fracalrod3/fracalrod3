- 👋 Hi, I’m @fracalrod3
- 👀 I’m interested in: Python, JavaScript, HTML, Django, beautifoulSoup and many more! But also games, design and I have many ideas but currently WIP
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: rly nothin' even though college's supposed to teach u a lot, i mean i'm learning it's just that i have to do it all by myself
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: idk i'm up for whatever
- 📫 How to reach me: yea you'd wish i'd tell u huh
- 😄 Pronouns: Giorno/Giovanna
- ⚡ Fun fact: Idk, college's hard, i didn't sign up for this, i mean i could do great but i kinda wanna do what makes me happy, idk i just wanna get some experience, learn some things and escape from this hellish education system that doesn't teach u anythin and just takes everything man, it's awful, it leaves you without any motivation and kills whatever dreams you could have of achieving anything or doing whatever, i'm trying but it's so hard :(
